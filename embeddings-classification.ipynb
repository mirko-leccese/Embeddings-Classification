    "Roughly speaking, *embeddings* are a numerical representation of words, sentence or entire pieces of text, in terms of *vectors* in high-dimensional vector spaces. Before the advent of modern algorithms in deep learning, there were already exist several algorithms to convert words into numbers. The most common is probably the so-called *Count Vectorizer* method, which works as follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let suppose to have a vocabulary $V$ of $N$ words, each one identified by an index $i$ and that the word \"Hello\" is at position $i=100$. Then, a represention of the word \"Hello\" can be defined as:\n",
    "$$ w^i_k = \\delta_{ik}$$\n",
    "where $\\delta_{ik}$ is the Delta Kronecker, i.e. $\\delta_{ik} = 1$ if $k=1$, otherwise 0.Despite its simplicity, this method has several drawbacks:\n",
    "- when we have a large vocabulary, vector representations of words are *sparse* in nature, leading to computational inefficiency in most applications:\n",
    "- vectorized words are all orthogonal to each others, therefore this method lacks of a *semantic* understanding of the language since similar words will still have a vanishing distance (we will return on the distance, hence *metric* definition in embedding spaces later)\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations were addressed **Word2Vec** algorithm, which is one of the pioneering techniques for learning word embeddings. The fundamental concept behind Word2Vec, and its derived methods, is to replace the discrete and sparse word vector represention with a *dense and continuous* representation. Consequently, the representation becomes *distributed*, meaning that the word is spread across all the dimensions. Moreover, Word2Vec leverages the concept of the so-called **Distributional Semantics**, which involves understanding a word's meaning through its contextual associations, that is its *context*.\n",

    "    <img src=\"images/word_embedding.png\" alt=\"Image Alt Text\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive description of the Word2Vec algorithm is beyond the scope of this notebook. However, it is worth briefly highlighting how it operates, particularly the Skip-Gram implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider all words $\\vec{w}$ in our vocabulary $V$ and first initiliaze vector components to real random numbers. Let then consider a piece of text, where each word occupy a position defined by the index $p$. For each position, we define the *center word* as the word at position $p$ (i.e. $\\vec{w}^p$), and the *context words* as words within the window $[p-m, p+m]$ where $m$ defines the window extent in terms of words number. The goal is to maximize the probability of the context words given the center word, in other words the probability of our model predicting the context words given the center word. This probability can be defined through the following *likelihood function*:\n",
    "$$ L(\\theta) = \\prod_p \\prod_{-m \\leq j \\leq m, j\\neq 0} P(\\vec{w}_{p+j} | \\vec{w}_{p}; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first product runs over the context window, the second runs over all available positions within the text. The above function can be written in a simpler form for maximization by taking the negative $\\log$:\n",
    "$$ J(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{n_p} \\log L(\\theta) = - \\frac{1}{n_p} \\sum_p \\sum_{-m \\leq j \\leq m, j\\neq 0}P(\\vec{w}_{p+j} | \\vec{w}_{p}; \\theta)$$\n",
    "where $n_p$ is the number of positions within the text. There is just one parameter $\\theta$ in our model equation that has to be determined in the training phase. Such parameter arises from the explicit representation of $P(w_{p+j} | w_{p})$ conditional probabilities. Indeed, these can be modeled as follows. Suppose that each word can be represented by two vectors, that we call $\\vec{w}_c$ and $\\vec{w_t}$, where the former is used when the word is a context word, while the latter when the word is a center word ($t$ stands for \"target\"). Then, the probability of observing the context word given the target word is the following softmax function:\n",
    "$$ P(\\vec{w}_c | \\vec{w}_t) = \\frac{\\exp(\\vec{w}_c^T \\vec{w}_t)}{\\sum_{p \\in V} \\vec{w}_{p, c}^T \\vec{w}_t}$$\n",
    "Basically, the numerator captures the distance between the context nd target words, i.e. their similarity. The denominator is the sum of the dot product between the target word and all words in the vocubolary and acts as a normalization constant so that probabilities all add up to 1.\n",
    "Therefore, $\\theta$ will be a vector containing all pair of vectors $\\vec{w}_c$ and $\\vec{w}_{t}$ for each word in the vocabulary. If the vocabulary size is $n_p$ and each vector lies in a $d$-dimensional vector space (the embedding space), then $\\theta \\in \\mathcal{R}^{2dn_p}$. Its component can be then learned applied a optimization algorithm such as *gradient descent*. "

    "### Metrics in the embedding space: the cosine distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider that we've generated embeddings for two words using an available embedding generation algorithm. As embeddings encode word semantics, we can compute the distance between two embeddings to reflect the similarity between the original words, by introducing a metric in the embedding space. Once more, a thorough analysis of potential metrics is beyond our current scope (extensive literature exists on metric spaces!). Here, we introduce the simplest form of distance, which is suitable for most AI applications: the **cosine distance**. The cosine distance between two vectors $\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$D(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v})  = 1 - S(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v})$$\n",
    "where $S(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v})$ is the *cosine similarity* i.e.:\n",
    "$$S(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v}) = \\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\vec{u}^T \\vec{v}}{||\\vec{u}|| \\ || \\vec{v}||}$$\n",
    "that is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. Since $\\cos(\\alpha) \\in [-1,1]$, the cosine distances ranges between 0 and 2. "

    "\n",
    "Embeddings and their relative distances can be used in a variety of AI Applications but the most common are the followings:\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: the user input a query which is transformed into an embedding. Such embedding is matched with available embeddings (e.g. stored in a **vector database**) and the most similar are retrieved. The foundation of the technique lies again in the *distributional hypothesis*, namely that semantically similar texts are embedded more closely in the vector space;\n",
    "- **Recommendation Engines**: a recommendation system can return the embeddings that most closely match embeddings representing user's interests. Suppose for example that we have access to the user history about his reading in an article magazine. We can average the embeddings relative to read documents to produce a \"mean embedding\" representing user's interest and match with all document embeddings to find the most similar, i.e. recommendable articles;\n",
    "- **Classification Tasks**: again, we embed the text we want to classify and match with embeddings representing the available class descriptions. This is at times called **zero-shot classification**, since, unlike traditional supervise learning algorithms for classification such as *logistic regression* or *neural networks*, we do not use already labeled data. We just exploit the semantical similarity between data and class.\n",

Each embedding is a 1536-dimensional vector, since the method we are using, `text-embedding-ada-002` produces embeddings of such dimensionality. To visualize embeddings and verify if semantically similar words are proximate, we can project this 1536-dimensional embedding space into a lower-dimensional space, such as a 2D Euclidean space. It's important to note that in undertaking such a projection, a considerable amount of information is lost, thus dimensionality reduction must be used with caution.

    "For movie at index 10, namely *\"Forever My Girl\"*, the embeddings classifier has matched the following three genres: **Romance**, **Musical** and **Music**. Notably, Romance and Music are correctly identified. The embedding classifier also matched *Musical* because is this class is very close to *Music* in the geometric space. This misclassification could be due to either the lack of precise descriptions for our classes (which would differentiate Music from Musical) or the absence of key information in the title and summary text, leading to a match with *Drama* instead of Musical.

    "How can we assess the accuracy of our classifier? As an initial and straightforward metric, we can utilize the **fraction of misclassified genres**. Prior to computing the accuracy, we should recognize that the number of predicted genres and actual genres may not always align. This discrepancy arises because we consistently retrieve the top 5 closest matches, as some films may belong to multiple genres. While a more sophisticated approach could involve setting a threshold in the cosine distance and ceasing to return matches above this threshold, for our current task, we can stay simple. We can achieve this by merely truncating the predicted genres list in the `Predicted_Genres`column to match the length of the corresponding actual genre list in the `Current_Genres` column."
